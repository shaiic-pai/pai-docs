## How to Add CPU Nodes and Set Up CPU-only VC

In current release, support for CPU nodes is limited. The [installation guide](./installation-guide.md) won't work if you only have CPU worker nodes. However, after you set up the cluster with GPU worker nodes, you can add CPU worker nodes and CPU-only virtual cluster. This section is a detailed guide.

Adding CPU nodes is not much differnt from adding GPU nodes, as we have decribed in [How to Add and Remove Nodes](./how-to-add-and-remove-nodes.md). So you can follow that document basically. Meanwhile, there are two differences for CPU-only nodes:

In the preparation phase, you don't need to check GPU driver and `nvidia-container-runtime`.

In the hived scheduler setting, you should omit `gpu` field or use `gpu: 0` in `skuTypes` for your CPU-only VCs. Don't mix CPU nodes with GPU nodes. Here is an example:

```yaml
hivedscheduler:
config: |
  physicalCluster:
    skuTypes:
      K80:
        gpu: 1
        cpu: 5
        memory: 56334Mi
      CPU:
        cpu: 1
        memory: 10240Mi
    cellTypes:
      K80-NODE:
        childCellType: K80
        childCellNumber: 4
        isNodeLevel: true
      K80-NODE-POOL:
        childCellType: K80-NODE
        childCellNumber: 2
      CPU-NODE:
        childCellType: CPU
        childCellNumber: 8
        isNodeLevel: true
      CPU-NODE-POOL:
        childCellType: CPU-NODE
        childCellNumber: 1
    physicalCells:
    - cellType: K80-NODE-POOL
      cellChildren:
      - cellAddress: k80-worker1
      - cellAddress: k80-worker1
    - cellType: FAKE-NODE-POOL
      cellChildren:
      - cellAddress: cpu-worker1
  virtualClusters:
    default:
      virtualCells:
      - cellType: K80-NODE-POOL.K80-NODE
        cellNumber: 2
    cpu:
      virtualCells:
      - cellType: CPU-NODE-POOL.CPU-NODE
        cellNumber: 1
```

Explanation of the above example: Supposing we have a node named `cpu-worker1` in Kubernetes. It has 80GB memory and 8 allocatable CPUs (please use `kubectl describe cpu-worker1` to confirm the allocatable resources). Then, in `skuTypes`, we can set a `CPU` sku, which has 1 CPU and 10240 MB (80GB / 8) memory. You can reserve some memory or CPUs if you want. `CPU-NODE` and `CPU-NODE-POOL` are set correspondingly in the `cellTypes`. Finally, the setting will result in one `default` VC and one `cpu` VC. The `cpu` VC contains one CPU node.


## Submit CPU-only Jobs

If you want to submit a CPU-only job, please submit it directly to the CPU-only VC. A special requirement is that, you should use exactly the same GPU number as the CPU number you want. For example, if you want to use 8 CPUs, you should set 8 GPUs and 8 CPUs as follows:

<img src="./imgs/cpu-resource.png" width="60%" height="60%" />

This requirement may be fixed in the future.
